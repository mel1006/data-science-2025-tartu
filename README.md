# UK Road Safety – Accident Severity Analysis

### 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze road accident patterns in the **United Kingdom** and identify the key factors influencing **accident severity**.  
The work follows the **CRISP-DM methodology**, focusing on the stages of **Business Understanding**, **Data Understanding**, and later **Modeling**.

The main goals are:
- To understand **when, where, and under what conditions** road accidents occur.  
- To identify the **factors influencing accident severity**.  
- To build a **predictive model** that classifies accidents as *Slight*, *Serious*, or *Fatal* based on environmental and situational data.

### 🗂️ Dataset Information
The data used in this project come from the official  
**[UK Department for Transport – Road Safety Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles?resource=download&select=Accident_Information.csv)**,  
available publicly via **Kaggle**.

- **Source:** Kaggle – UK Department for Transport  
- **File used:** `Accident_Information.csv`  
- **Years selected:** 2012–2017  
- **Records after filtering:** ~830,000  
- **Variables:** 34 (including accident date, time, location, weather, lighting, road surface, casualties, and severity)

Because the dataset exceeds GitHub’s file size limit (700MB+), it is **not stored in this repository**.  
Instead, the dataset can be downloaded directly from Kaggle using the link above.
